## Hi, I'm Mariusz✌🏻

### ~ whoami

I work as a Tech Lead in ING Advanced Analytics, where I am a part of a team contributing to [Data Analytics Platform](https://medium.com/wbaa/the-data-analytics-platform-91c6295c4e2). 

My current area of influence is within the **data discoverability**. 

In the past I was heavily involved in:

- Writing and extending framework for data ingestion
- Writing and extending frameworks for data quality / profiling

I have strong experience in distributed systems, leveraging modern technologies such as:
- Kubernetes
- Apache Airflow
- Apache Spark
- Apache Superset
- Confluent Kafka
- Elastic Stack (formely ELK)
 
#### Certifications

I hold following certificates:
- Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect (PCA)
- Google Cloud Associate Engineer (AE)
- Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD)

#### Conducting trainings 🎓

I also am a trainer for a Polish training company [Sages](https://www.sages.pl/) where I am responsible for conducting Elastic Stack and Spark related trainings. So far I've conducted 30+ trainings for over 250 people.

### Open Source
